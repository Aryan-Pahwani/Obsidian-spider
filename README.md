## How to use:

1. Drag the obsidian-spider.js script into your folder.
2. Add in this bit to your <head> tag.

<script src="obsidian-spider.js"></script>

 ```HTML
  <script>
    spider('OBSIDIAN_FILE_PATH');
  </script>
   ```
3. Set OBSIDIAN_FILE_PATH to the relative path from the obsidian-spider.js file to your obsidian .md file. Obsidian stores it's files as .md markdown files. Which we'll use to generate our website.
